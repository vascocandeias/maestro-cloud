# MAESTRO in the cloud
This repo contains the functions used in the cloud implementation of [MAESTRO](https://vascocandeias.github.io/maestro), a website for multivariate time series analysis using dynamic Bayesian networks which can be [deployed on-premises](#getting-started). The cloud architecture is depicted bellow and was deployed in AWS.
